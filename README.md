# Decipher

These are some technique helping to decrpt the ciphertext using crytanalysis.
The crytanalysis that we are using in this program are:
- Frequency Analysis
- Kisaski Test
- Index of Coincidence

After analyzing the ciphertext, we can decide which method are the best to decrypt the ciphertext:
- Shift decipher
- Substituition
- Affine decipher
- Vigen√®re decipher
- One time pads

After this assignment, student can learn the difference between using Brute Force and Cryptanalysis to decipher the ciphertext.
This assignment is designed by Dr. Nirnimesh Ghose, in class CSCE 477 - Fall 2024.
The codes should be used for studying purposed. It is prohibited to copy my codes and submit to your assignment.
I will not hold any responsible if you are doing this.

I have fun when I study Cryptography and Cyber Security. It can be frustrated, but make me feel so excited when I can detect the key of the ciphertext. 
I hope this program can encorage students in self-studying, and self-improving if they want to pursuit the Cybersecurity career.
